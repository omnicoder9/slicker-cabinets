create a web app for a cabinet carpentry business:
 - company name: slicker cabinets, owned and operated by Chris Cool
 - tech stack: go, gin framework, jquery, typescript, PostgreSQL
 - nav bar buttons: services, reviews, contact me, about
    - services button should open a nested dropdown with categories and subcategories
 - contact me page: forms for name, email address, message; sanitized/secure inputs, button to submit message; message goes to an email address; when the user submits, a confirmation message should appear
 - each service gets its own section on the main page
 - for each service, list a short description and include an example photo, with a button that says "get quote"
 - when the user clicks the "get quote" button for a particular service, it goes to the contact me page and auto populates the message form with an example message specific to the service.
 - about page should include an example photo and short bio
 - dark/light mode switching button in navbar
 - use generic publicly available images
 - log in feature for internal portal access
 - data hard-coded in the back end for demo purposes
 - create simple but realistic rest apis and data models
 - include any necessary or desirable imports for this project
